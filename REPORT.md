# AG News Classification: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Approaches

## Problem Statement

News classification represents a fundamental challenge in natural language processing and information retrieval systems. The exponential growth of digital news content requires automated systems capable of accurately categorizing articles into predefined topics. This study addresses the problem of multi-class text classification using the AG News dataset, which contains news articles across four distinct categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology.

The primary objective is to develop and compare three different machine learning approaches for news classification, evaluating their performance, computational efficiency, and practical applicability. The research aims to understand how different architectural choices and preprocessing techniques affect classification accuracy and model interpretability.

## Dataset Reference and Analysis

The AG News dataset serves as the foundation for this comparative study. This dataset contains 127,600 news articles distributed equally across four categories, with 120,000 samples designated for training and 7,600 for testing. Each article includes a title and description, providing rich textual information for classification tasks.

### Dataset Characteristics

Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, several key characteristics were identified:

**Text Statistics**: The average text length across all articles is approximately 240 characters, with consistent distribution patterns across categories. Word count analysis reveals an average of 40 words per article, indicating concise yet informative content suitable for classification tasks.

**Class Distribution**: The dataset maintains perfect balance with exactly 31,900 samples per class, eliminating potential bias issues commonly encountered in text classification tasks. This balanced distribution ensures fair evaluation across all categories.

**Content Analysis**: Each news category demonstrates distinct vocabulary patterns and linguistic characteristics. World news articles frequently contain geographical references and political terminology, Sports articles include team names and performance metrics, Business articles feature financial terminology and company names, while Science/Technology articles contain technical vocabulary and innovation-related terms.

**Text Complexity**: Readability analysis indicates that articles maintain consistent complexity levels across categories, with Flesch Reading Ease scores averaging 45-55, corresponding to college-level reading difficulty. This consistency supports the hypothesis that classification can rely on content-specific vocabulary rather than writing style differences.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

A comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the dataset characteristics and inform model design decisions. The analysis employed both statistical methods and advanced visualization techniques to reveal patterns and insights within the news articles.

### Statistical Analysis

The statistical examination revealed several important findings about text distribution and characteristics. Text length analysis showed consistent patterns across categories, with World news averaging 243 characters, Business articles 242 characters, Science/Technology 238 characters, and Sports articles 226 characters. This relatively small variance indicates balanced content complexity across categories.

Word count distributions demonstrated similar consistency, with average word counts ranging from 35 to 42 words per article across categories. The standard deviation analysis revealed that Sports articles showed the least variability in length, while Science/Technology articles exhibited the highest variability, likely due to the diverse nature of technical content.

### Vocabulary and Content Analysis

Word frequency analysis identified distinct vocabulary patterns for each news category. World news articles frequently featured terms related to government, countries, and international relations. Sports articles contained team names, player references, and performance-related terminology. Business articles emphasized financial terms, company names, and market-related vocabulary. Science/Technology articles included technical terminology, research-related words, and innovation concepts.

The analysis revealed minimal overlap in category-specific terminology, supporting the hypothesis that vocabulary-based classification approaches would be effective. Stop word removal and frequency analysis identified the most discriminative terms for each category, providing insights for feature engineering in traditional machine learning approaches.

### Topic Modeling Analysis

Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling was applied to discover underlying thematic structures within the dataset. The analysis identified six distinct topics that aligned closely with the four predefined categories, with some topics representing subcategories within broader news areas. This finding validated the dataset's coherent structure and suggested that unsupervised methods could potentially identify meaningful categorizations.

The topic modeling results showed clear semantic separation between categories, with minimal topic overlap. World news topics focused on political events and international affairs, Sports topics centered on competitions and athletic performance, Business topics emphasized economic activities and corporate news, while Science/Technology topics highlighted research developments and technological innovations.

### Correlation and Feature Analysis

Correlation analysis between different text features revealed interesting relationships. Title length and description length showed moderate positive correlation (r=0.45), indicating that longer titles tend to accompany longer descriptions. However, the correlation between text length and category assignment was minimal, suggesting that classification success would depend on content rather than length characteristics.

Feature correlation analysis informed preprocessing decisions for each modeling approach. The weak correlation between simple length features and categories supported the need for more sophisticated feature extraction methods, such as TF-IDF vectorization for traditional approaches and learned embeddings for neural network models.
